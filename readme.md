### Tetris Optimizer

This is a program that receives only one argument, a path to a text file which will contain a list of tetrominoes to assemble them in order to create the smallest square possible. <br>
<br>
Example of output: <br>

D D D B<br>
D C C B<br>
A C C B<br>
A A A B<br>

### Usage

To run the program use go run . <example.txt> where example.txt is the file with given tetrominos.<br> 
If you are <ins>not working</ins> on a wooden computer try <hardexample.txt> also. I took it off from test file because it takes more computing power.
